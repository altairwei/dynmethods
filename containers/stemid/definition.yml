parameters:
  clustnr:
    type: integer
    default: 30
    upper: 100
    lower: 10
    description: maximum number of clusters for the computation of the gap statistic
      or derivation of the cluster number by the saturation criterion. Default is
      30. If more major cell types are expected a higher number should be chosen.
  bootnr:
    type: integer
    default: 50
    upper: 100
    lower: 20
    description: number of booststrapping runs for clusterboot. Default is 50
  metric:
    type: discrete
    default: pearson
    values:
    - pearson
    - spearman
    - kendall
    - euclidean
    - maximum
    - manhattan
    - canberra
    - binary
    - minkowski
    description: the input data are transformed to a distance object. Distances can
      be computed based on different metrics. Possible values are "pearson", "spearman",
      "logpearson", "euclidean", "kendall", "maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", "binary"
      or "minkowski". Default is "pearson". In case of the correlation based methods,
      the distance is computed as 1 - correlation. K-medoids clustering is performed
      on this distance object.
  num_cluster_method:
    type: discrete
    default: sat
    values:
    - sat
    - gap
    - manual
    description: the type of clustering method, can be sat, gap or manual
  SE.method:
    type: discrete
    default: Tibs2001SEmax
    values:
    - firstSEmax
    - Tibs2001SEmax
    - globalSEmax
    - firstmax
    - globalmax
    description: the clustering routine calls a modified version of the maxSE function
      from the cluster package to determine the first local maximum of the gap statistic.
      By default, we use the method "Tibs2001SEmax" for calling the first local maximum
      (see specification of maxSE). This method requires that the maximum exceeds
      the values of its neighbors by a fraction of their standard deviation. This
      fraction is defined by the parameter SE.factor. All methods defined for the
      original maxSE function can also be used.
  SE.factor:
    type: numeric
    default: 0.25
    upper: 1.0
    lower: 0.0e+00
    description: fraction of the standard deviation by which the local maximum is
      required to differ from the neighboring points it is compared to. Default is
      0.25.
  B.gap:
    type: integer
    default: 50
    upper: 100
    lower: 20
    description: number of bootstrap runs for the calculation of the gap statistic.
      Default is 50.
  cln:
    type: integer
    default: 30
    upper: 100
    lower: 20
    description: the number of clusters for k-medoids clustering. Default is 0. In
      this case, the cluster number is determined based on the gap statistic6 and
      do.gap has to be TRUE.
  FUNcluster:
    type: discrete
    default: kmedoids
    values:
    - kmedoids
    - kmeans
    - hclust
    description: 'the clustering method applied. One of the following methods can
      be selected: kmedoids, kmeans, hclust. RaceID3 is designed for k-medoids clustering
      and therefore it is recommended to use only the kmedoids method. Default is
      kmedoids.'
  dimred_method:
    type: discrete
    default: tsne
    values:
    - tsne
    - sammon
    - tsne_initcmd
    description: the dimensionality reduction method, can be tsne, sammon or tsne_initcmd
  outminc:
    type: integer
    default: 0
    upper: 100
    lower: 0
    description: expression cutoff for the identification of outlier genes is defined.
      Default is 5.
  outlg:
    type: integer
    default: 2
    upper: 100
    lower: 0
    description: minimal number of outlier genes required to identify a cell as an
      outlier. Default is 2.
  probthr:
    type: numeric
    default: 0.001
    upper: 0.1
    lower: 1.0e-10
    description: defines the probability threshold for outlier calling. If the probability
      of observing a given expression level for a gene in a cell is lower than this
      cutoff (based on the negative binomial distribution for the calibrated noise
      model), the cell is considered an outlier for this gene. Default is 10-3.
  thr_lower:
    type: integer
    default: -10.0
    upper: -1.0
    lower: -100.0
    description: lower probability for which the number of outliers is computed in
      order to plot the dependence of the number of outliers on the probability threshold
  thr_upper:
    type: numeric
    default: -5.0
    upper: -1.0
    lower: -100.0
    description: upper probability for which the number of outliers is computed in
      order to plot the dependence of the number of outliers on the probability threshold
  outdistquant:
    type: numeric
    default: 0.95
    upper: 1.0
    lower: 0.0e+00
    description: outlier cells are merged to outlier clusters if their similarity
      exceeds the outdistquant-quantile of the similarity distribution for all pairs
      of cells that are together in one of the original clusters. Default is 0.95.
  nmode:
    type: logical
    default: no
    description: Boolean argument. If nmode is set to TRUE the assignment to inter-cluster
      links for each cell is not done based on the longest projection, but based on
      identifying the cluster (other than the cluster the cell belongs to) that contains
      the nearest neighbor of the cell, i. e. the cell with the most similar transcriptome.
      The coordinate on the assigned link is still derived based on the projection.
      Default is FALSE.
  pdishuf:
    type: integer
    default: 2000.0
    upper: 10000.0
    lower: 100.0
    description: positive integer. This is the number of randomizations to be performed.
      As a rule of thumb this number should be at least one order of magnitude larger
      than the desired p-value on the significance of the number of cells on a connection.
      Default is 2000.
  pthr:
    type: numeric
    default: 0.01
    upper: 0.0001
    lower: 0.0e+00
    description: positive number. This number corresponds to the p-value threshold,
      which is used to determine, whether the magnitude of an observed trajectory
      is significantly larger than observed for the randomized background distribution.
      This criterion is not used to infer significance of a link, but shown in a graphical
      representation of the tree
  pethr:
    type: numeric
    default: 0.01
    upper: 0.0001
    lower: 0.0e+00
    description: positive number. This number corresponds to the p-value threshold,
      which isused to determine for each link if it is populated by a number of cellssignificantly
      larger than expected for the randomized background distribution. This p-value
      threshold determines, which connections are considered validdifferentiation
      trajectories in the derived lineage tree.
  pvalue_cutoff:
    type: numeric
    default: 0.05
    lower: 0.0e+00
    upper: 1.0
    description: Upper cutoff of p-value for determining significant edges

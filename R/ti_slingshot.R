#' @title Inferring a trajectory inference using Slingshot
#' 
#' @description
#' Will generate a trajectory using
#' [Slingshot](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-018-4772-0).
#' 
#' This method was wrapped inside a
#' [container](https://github.com/dynverse/dynmethods/tree/master/containers/slingshot).
#' The original code of this method is available
#' [here](https://github.com/kstreet13/slingshot).

#' inference for single-cell transcriptomics. BMC Genomics 19.
#' 
#' @param ndim integer; The number of dimensions (default: `3L`; range: from `2L`
#' to `20L`)
#' @param nclus integer; Number of clusters (default: `5L`; range: from `2L` to
#' `40L`)
#' @param dimred discrete; Which dimensionality reduction method to use. (default:
#' `"pca"`; values: {`"pca"`, `"mds"`, `"tsne"`, `"ica"`, `"lle"`, `"mds_sammon"`,
#' `"mds_isomds"`, `"mds_smacof"`, `"umap"`})
#' @param shrink numeric; Logical or numeric between 0 and 1, determines whether
#' and how much to shrink branching lineages toward their average prior to the
#' split. (default: `1`; range: from `0` to `1`)
#' @param reweight logical; Logical, whether to allow cells shared between
#' lineages to be reweighted during curve-fitting. If \code{TRUE}, cells shared
#' between lineages will be weighted by: distance to nearest curve / distance to
#' curve.
#' @param reassign logical; Logical, whether to reassign cells to lineages at each
#' iteration. If TRUE, cells will be added to a lineage when their projection
#' distance to the curve is less than the median distance for all cells currently
#' assigned to the lineage. Additionally, shared cells will be removed from a
#' lineage if their projection distance to the curve is above the 90th percentile
#' and their weight along the curve is less than 0.1.
#' @param thresh numeric; Numeric, determines the convergence criterion. Percent
#' change in the total distance from cells to their projections along curves must
#' be less than thresh. Default is 0.001, similar to principal.curve. (default:
#' `0.001`; range: from `1e-05` to `1e+05`)
#' @param maxit integer; Numeric, maximum number of iterations, see
#' principal.curve. (default: `10L`; range: from `0L` to `50L`)
#' @param stretch numeric; Numeric factor by which curves can be extrapolated
#' beyond endpoints. Default is 2, see principal.curve. (default: `2`; range: from
#' `0` to `5`)
#' @param smoother discrete; Choice of scatter plot smoother. Same as
#' principal.curve, but "lowess" option is replaced with "loess" for additional
#' flexibility. (default: `"smooth.spline"`; values: {`"smooth.spline"`,
#' `"loess"`, `"periodic.lowess"`})
#' @param shrink.method discrete; Character denoting how to determine the
#' appropriate amount of shrinkage for a branching lineage. Accepted values are
#' the same as for \code{kernel} in [density()] (default is \code{"cosine"}), as
#' well as \code{"tricube"} and \code{"density"}. See 'Details' for more.
#' (default: `"cosine"`; values: {`"cosine"`, `"tricube"`, `"density"`})
#' @inheritParams dynwrap::create_container_ti_method
#' 
#' @return A TI method wrapper to be used together with
#' \code{\link[dynwrap:infer_trajectories]{infer_trajectory}}
